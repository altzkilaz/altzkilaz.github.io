Ping pong score keeper
(My very first web development coding project)

-Added confetti and interactive pictures to represent the score situation

V0.2
-Bug fixes regarding first to two wins causes issues in the next reset

V0.3

V0.3.1
-Quick Hotfix on First to two, Supposed to be when both players is on a tie it should reset the first to two and the players must thrive to get the first two consecutive win not counting the previous tie score
